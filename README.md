# Design and Development of a Shape-Adaptive Biomimetic Underactuated Tendon-Driven Gripper

This repository contains the design and experimental work for a **mechanical soft gripper** developed during a research project at **Tohoku University, Japan**.

The goal of this project was to create a gripper capable of safely handling delicate **CubeSats** and irregularly shaped objects using soft-robotics principles combined with mechanical actuation inspired by **S. Hirose’s work**.

- Apply uniform gripping force  
- Adapt to different object shapes  

### Mechanism
- Tendon-driven, underactuated gripper  
- Multi-link fingers with pulley systems  
- Motor-controlled grip and release tendons
