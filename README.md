# Design and Development of a Shape-Adaptive Biomimetic Underactuated Tendon-Driven Gripper

This repository contains the design and experimental work for a **mechanical soft gripper** developed during a research project at **Tohoku University, Japan**.

The goal of this project was to create a gripper capable of safely handling delicate **CubeSats** and irregularly shaped objects using soft-robotics principles combined with mechanical actuation inspired by **S. Hirose’s work**.
